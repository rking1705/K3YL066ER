Out of curioisity, I did my research on keylogging and wanted to create one myself.  
By no means is this code original or my intellectual property.
This is for educational purposes only, however it is functional but not strong enough to be harmful
This code uses python and a git repository by @moses-palmer "https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput.git"

Code Breakdown
- Import pynput from "https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput.git"
This will allow us access to the user keyboard.
- Import Key, and Listener
This will store the keys the user presses as a variable "key" while "listener" is told to pay attention to the keys and store them 

-Set the directory to where the log file will be saved, I want this in the same file so log_dir = ""

-Next, config the logging style. I want the file containing the keys to be named "K3Y_l0g.txt" and setting the level to DEBUG, allows it to capture all types of input
-Then format the times and messages so the log is clear and readable

-There needs to be a funtion that stores each key to the log as its pressed, the on_press function takes the key from the user and stores it directly in the log.

-Lastly enable the listener to capture all of this data

Lessons learned
 
1. I know how a keylogger functions, and have become more aware of spotting them and how to protect against it.
2. Windows and Chrome automatically flag my file as a virus or PUP.
3. I am able to bypass GMAIL by putting the file inside a google drive file.
4. This keylogger will ONLY work if the user has weak Windows and Browser settings.
5. IF I fully enable Windows and Browser anti-virus settings, I will be safe from ametuer keylogging attacks.
6. Lastly, I discovered that keyloggers can be found in Task Manager and is easy to disable if aware.
